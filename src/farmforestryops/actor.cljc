  "FarmForestryOpsActor — the ISCO-08 8341 mobile farm and forestry
  plant operators scheduling/logistics coordination actor as a
  `langgraph.graph/state-graph` (ADR-2607121000 / CLAUDE.md Actors
  section). One graph run = one scheduling/logistics coordination
  request (intake → advise → govern → decide → commit/hold, with a
  human-approval interrupt for escalated proposals). No infinite
  internal loop; checkpointed per superstep so an interrupted run can
  resume after human sign-off. Modeled on cloud-itonami-isco-3313's
  accountingsupport.actor.

  ```text
  :intake -> :advise -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit            (:ok? true)
                                             +-> :request-approval   (:escalate? true, interrupt-before)
                                             +-> :hold               (:hard? true)
  ```

  The unconditional invariant: the FarmForestryOpsAdvisor can never
  directly commit a coordination record the FarmForestryOpsGovernor
  refuses, and this actor never operates equipment or overrides an
  operator's on-site safety judgment — every commit-record! call is
  gated behind `:decide`."
